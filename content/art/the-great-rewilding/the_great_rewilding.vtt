00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:05.285
What is the best way to live?

2
00:00:06.665 --> 00:00:09.565
It is a question that has occupied philosophers

3
00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:14.445
for thousands of years. In earlier generations, like those

4
00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:16.565
at the beginning of the 21st century,

5
00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:20.125
many people were confused about this question of how

6
00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:23.645
to live, especially when it came to the material world.

7
00:00:24.985 --> 00:00:27.565
We refer to the humans of that time

8
00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:29.965
as the Plastic Rectangle People,

9
00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:33.725
because they carried these objects at all times

10
00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:38.405
as a means of enforcing norms and rules in their culture.

11
00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:42.645
Each citizen held at least one as a fetish

12
00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:45.805
with the belief that it would protect them

13
00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.485
and separate them from nature.

14
00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:53.165
Strangely, there was no shortage of talk about nature.

15
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.445
They wrote thousands of words about the environment.

16
00:00:56.535 --> 00:01:00.005
There were billions of images of mountains, animals,

17
00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:01.885
sunsets, and trees.

18
00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:04.045
Most of this talking

19
00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:08.605
and thinking took place inside brutally constructed spaces,

20
00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:11.525
touching and staring at a piece of plastic

21
00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:13.765
and electronics, one

22
00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:17.005
of the most synthetic, cursed objects ever made.

23
00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:20.205
The people of this era seemed

24
00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.605
to be stuck in something we might call a kind

25
00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:24.645
of "worldly acetecism".

26
00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:26.645
By that, we mean they wanted

27
00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:29.245
to withdraw from the natural world,

28
00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:30.845
but still be connected to it.

29
00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:33.965
To many, nature seemed like a fine concept

30
00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:37.365
or idea. Upon activating one

31
00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:41.925
of these plastic rectangles, the beholder was often greeted

32
00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:46.325
with an unnatural, glowing image of a green hill or field.

33
00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:51.245
But actually engaging with life physically directly.

34
00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:54.725
They felt it was too messy, even dangerous.

35
00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:59.245
It seemed safer to stay inside with symbols

36
00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:04.285
and semantics, dreaming of a sterile mineral future

37
00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:08.125
where biology would be replaced by a completely

38
00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:12.685
artificial regime of numbers, order and smoothness.

39
00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:18.205
There were even extremists of that time who went so far as

40
00:02:18.265 --> 00:02:22.325
to suggest that civilization should run away from earthly

41
00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:27.205
nature to build a totally new, completely manufactured world

42
00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:29.525
of plastic and metal on the planet Mars.

43
00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:34.005
Looking back, we in our time can see the hubris

44
00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:39.165
of these fantasies of artificial simplicity

45
00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:41.725
and total environmental control.

46
00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:45.445
We also know of the tragic, destructive consequences

47
00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.405
of this willful blindness to material reality.

48
00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:52.725
And so, toward the end of that time of crisis

49
00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:58.565
began an age we called The Great Rewilding. We turned away

50
00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:01.045
from these technologies of extraction

51
00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:04.165
and pollution, abstraction and separation.

52
00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:07.445
Instead, we began to try ways of living

53
00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:10.205
that reconnected humanity to nature.

54
00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:14.885
We named this new way of life Sylvoculture

55
00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:18.085
after the old Latin word for forest.

56
00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:22.525
The name refers to the central role played

57
00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:24.765
by trees in our new society.

58
00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:29.405
They're so essential, in fact, we cannot live without them.

59
00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:34.325
Some of the first people of North America referred to trees

60
00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:36.645
as the "standing people".

61
00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:41.645
And in that line of thinking, we understood what we needed

62
00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:45.725
not only appreciate trees as the

63
00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:47.805
saviors of our planet,

64
00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:51.005
but we needed to see ourselves as

65
00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:55.605
fellow beings in a larger community of living creatures.

66
00:03:57.025 --> 00:04:00.365
We learned about how trees not only restore our air

67
00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:03.245
and soil, but how they communicate

68
00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:05.565
and sense changes in our environment.

69
00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:09.045
We found ways to learn the language of trees

70
00:04:09.225 --> 00:04:13.125
and their symbiotic relations with other life forms.

71
00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:18.485
We learned to appreciate the ecological economy

72
00:04:18.745 --> 00:04:22.845
of forests, which do not extract and pollute,

73
00:04:23.065 --> 00:04:26.885
but instead recycle much of the matter within them.

74
00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:32.405
And we reconnected to the first knowing of natural instincts

75
00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:34.205
and desires within ourselves.

76
00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:38.605
And so in the Great Rewilding, we began

77
00:04:38.605 --> 00:04:42.925
to put aside plastic rectangles, instead to pick up pieces

78
00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:44.405
of wood and leaves.

79
00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:48.925
We let go of the structures we clutched with

80
00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:54.365
chemical arms to grow, regenerative forms

81
00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:56.005
of shelter and provision.

82
00:04:57.265 --> 00:05:00.445
We disconnected our frenetic artificial networks

83
00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:04.805
and began to use the ab boreal networks of pheromones,

84
00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:06.405
roots, fungi and bacteria.

85
00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:09.765
We still struggle, but since we learned

86
00:05:09.785 --> 00:05:13.245
to speak the language of plants, we do

87
00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:15.165
so within a larger web of life,

88
00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:17.725
singing the poetic songs of trees.
