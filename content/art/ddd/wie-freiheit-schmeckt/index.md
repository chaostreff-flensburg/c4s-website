The Quest: Grocery shopping.

Gamification, originally created for people with ADHD, has helped me outsmart my own depression as well. Sometimes.

The self-driving car opened up new possibilities. My parents used to go grocery shopping for me. Now? Rent a car, get in, go.

I had to choose fruit by myself, to my sensory needs. Not too ripe, not too soft. After that, a drone helped me carry, to protect the back.

Now, I stood here. Home. With a ping, I concluded the quest, received experience points, digital confetti and a smiling emoticon - and got to bite into the gloriously crisp apple, green and without bruises. Sour. Juicy. 

This was the taste of freedom
