One day we will build a house. 

Time does not exist there. Everything is determined by its own rhythm, and the rooms are made for being, screaming, breathing. Depression is not a stain on the standard of a white wall, but allowed to sit at the table as a guest, next to other psycho and disability stuff. The plates are overflowing with future, sweet as honey.

A Hand of Fatima, commandingly blue, is displayed on the door by the entrance. It banishes evil. But don't worry, don't be afraid! You are nothing wicked, only misunderstood. 

You are allowed to be ill. Wander through this haunted house of yourself, safe in this house, our house. 

Here, there is no time. 

Here, there is all of time.
