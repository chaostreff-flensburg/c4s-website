Through the window of the train, people. Blurry, between exhaustion and joy and not yet being able to fully understand. In Deborah's head the words "In the name of the people" and the distant fear of looking somewhere to understand the rest. After that, the sentence from the people taking notes and displaying them. Above everything and anything.

Stations and people. The black flag with the colourful stripes. *The sky is blue*, Deborah thinks. An old song, but it's true. The things that came before are on her mind, the hardship before "In the name of the people".

At some point, the news screen: "Ableist sentenced to four years of prison for crimes against disabled people."

Deborah laughs. *The sky is blue.*
