We're sitting on a plant-covered roof. The air smells of summer. Jo has hacked the elevator code. "So you can enjoy the view for both of us."

I'm fidgeting with the joystick, my wheelchair rocking back and forth. I remember what Mrs. Herz told us today: That there was a time when inclusivity was not enshrined in Article 1 of the constitution. Jo frowns: "I wouldn't have been able to use a single app." "And people didn't greet you with 'What do you need today?' but by saying 'How are you?'" 
I can't help but laugh. A society without inclusivity. 
How absurd.
