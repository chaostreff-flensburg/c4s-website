title: Agents of CARE
author: Jenny Cazzola
alt: An illustration, drawn in green. It shows a piece of paper that looks like an announcement, with strips to rip off on the bottom. Most of the strips are already gone. On the majority of the announcement the words "We want you!" are written. On top of that is a hat that is supposed to remind you of Uncle Sam, with a star on it. Around the hat there is a ribbon in the colours of the disability flag.

WE WANT YOU!

YOU know how it feels when someone else takes care of you?

YOU are constantly asked if you need something?

But you know the feeling:

Nobody asks if you have something to give? Nobody thinks that you, too, can take care for others? A plant, a pet, children or a person you love.

WE do!

WE are looking for humans who understand that we all depend on each other.

WE are looking for you, your experience, your story, your competence.

Call us or write to us today.

Your application doesn't have to be perfect.

And neither do YOU.
