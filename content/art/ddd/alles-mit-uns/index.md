There was a knock on the door. Divana didn't have to look at her door drone, which immediately hummed around her. She had worked for this day for decades, but she wasn't done yet.

"Just a moment", she called and turned her solar wheelchair silently towards the old-fashioned mirror. The dark red dress was kneelength and adjusted perfectly to fit her and her wheelchair. The colourful diagonal lines on the collar reminded Divana of an disability pride flag from a historical image file. It had been a long way, and now she was here, of all places. But she would do her best. 

There was one more knock. "Your inauguration ceremony is starting soon, Madame Chancellor."
