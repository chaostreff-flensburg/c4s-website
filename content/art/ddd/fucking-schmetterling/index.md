![Text and title are hard to parse for screen readers, because they contain various mathematical formulas, crossed out text and graphical elements. There is a  German audio version in which Jamie-Lee explains the text and the formulas in it. You can find it on this website, too. There is no English audio version, though.](fucking-schmetterling.svg)
