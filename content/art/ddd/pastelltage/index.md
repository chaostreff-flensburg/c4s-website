The dull pain, like cotton, has the colour of peaches. Old Rose marks the point when I consider my first dose. Shades of purple mark the days I really take it. 

My calendar has the colour of berrys, for a long time there have been no more white days.

The thought has lost its edge. Mostly.

Even on pink days I go to work or to the movies, because otherwise I never would.

May I hope for pale yellow? It is still early.

"I won't join for the meeting later!"

No explanation needed.

Just the freedom to hold the face into the sun and enjoy an easy day.

Pale yellow.
