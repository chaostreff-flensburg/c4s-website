“interlaced” is a generative art project by bleeptrack that was developed as part of the ‘Call for Stories’ competition. It comprises an interactive generator website that continuously creates new node patterns from plants and cables. The patterns consist of triangular tiles that can be displayed in various combinations and arrangements.

Inspired by the ornaments of the La Tène period and Art Nouveau, plants climb artfully up cables. Jack plugs intertwine with climbing plants, while a USB-C port protrudes from a delicate blossom. This art project makes it clear that technology and nature do not have to be at odds with each other; on the contrary, they can coexist harmoniously. Can they even enter into a symbiosis?

“interlaced” visually explores the boundary between technology and nature: where does one begin and where does the other end? On the one hand, the title alludes to the television technology of the same name, which combines images from two interlaced fields. On the other hand, “interlaced” refers to the now rarely used technique of cable lacing, in which cable strands are artfully connected and formed with waxed yarn.

The central question that arises is: Isn't electricity and electromagnetism also part of nature? Isn't our brain a computer in biological form? Are we not all part of a large network?

“interlaced” invites us to explore the connecting threads between technology and nature and to envision the possibilities of a shared future in which both elements are in harmonious balance.
