(The role playing game was written in German. The main rules and playing material were translated by sirenensang and eskarina.)


Sometime in the future, an artificial intelligence - known simply as 'algorithm' -
has taken over thinking for mankind. The total
surveillance is all about progress and a uniform life according to
calculated standards. Anyone who does not fit into society is
removed by the algorithm. But in the midst of the supposed standardized society 
controlled by AI, chaos grows and flourishes. The creatures of
chaos are working towards utopia in order to be free. They found communities that organize in 
assemblies and practice resistance in their own way.
Hackers, philosophers and survivalists find a way to work against the algorithm and build a world that is
colorful and diverse. That is worth living in for everyone - even for
those who don't seem to fit into the system.

Beauty in Chaos is a narrative role-playing game in which players develop utopian visions and hopes together
to transform technical dystopias into utopias.
The well-known dystopias about the surveillance state, the
importance of social scoring and the overexploitation of nature for more and more
 technologies are part of our everyday lives. Gated communities, resource
exhaustion and much more are real. *Works for me* must become more *Tu Wat* and
*Unlocked*. Beauty in Chaos enables joint thought experiments,
because the game is about telling and experiencing utopias in order to think new ways
and give yourself hope. Or about immersing yourself in a feeling of
chaos and having fun turning things upside down.
The role-playing game is designed for 3-6 players and is based on the Belonging
outside Belonging Engine by Avery Alder.
