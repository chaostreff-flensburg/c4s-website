The Chaos Computer Club just turned 42 years old. Time to celebrate and take an artistic look at the core idea of the club. Why are we doing this, where do we want to take the club and society and how do we envision the future? Show us and describe your ideas and visions!

Some of you may have noticed that we’ve been talking a lot about utopias for some time now and that we keep asking people what they want the future to look like. We think that parts of the club, of society and especially the issues that are present in the public eye are far too dystopian and that people need positive visions of the future in order to develop enthusiasm and engagement.

To this end, we would like to support artists with a grant in the coming year to present their utopias. We want to collect videos, images, texts, audios, comics, games and much more and show them in a vernissage at 38C3. We also want to exhibit them digitally so that as many people as possible can see the resulting works of art. Therefore we need digital art (this can also be a photo series of an installation).

We call on all artists (and those who want to become ones) to show us their image of the CCC and the positive influence it can have on society, politics and the world of technology. We are looking forward to your utopias!

Apply from 02 Jan to 29 Feb 2024 for a scholarship between 420 € and 4200 €.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

### How will the grant be paid out?

After the advisory board has confirmed the grant, the CCC will conclude a contract with the artist. Subsequently the full grant amount will be paid out.

### Where is the money coming from?

Chaos Computer Club e.V. (a registered association recognised as a non-profit in Germany) is funding the overall amount of 23,000 €. Information on how to support CCC e.V. can be found [here](https://www.ccc.de/en/membership). Technical support for web hosting, the application portal and e-mail communication is supplied by [Chaostreff Flensburg e.V.](https://chaostreff-flensburg.de/).

### Is there a way of extending the grant?

In the current phase, this is not possible. We can neither increase the grant amount nor postpone the next Congress, where the presentation is planned to take place :)

### What can be an eligible project?

Briefly: Videos, images, comics, games, everything in between and a number of things beyond.
Fundamentally, anything that can be experienced through digital channels and deals with the topics explained above.
Sculptures, installations, performances etc. are not possible unless they can be experienced in digital form.

### Until when can I apply?

The application deadline is 29 February 2024, 23:42 CET (UTC+0100).
We will not be able to accept applications after this deadline.

### How about accessibility?

We want to make the art available to as many people as possible, which is why we welcome projects that take accessibility into account. This could involve transcripts for audio files or descriptions of images. We are open for other creative concepts as well.

### Can a group of artists apply?

Every project can be submitted by one or several artists. We recommend that a group agrees on how to split the grant amount and which license to use for the artwork(s) before applying. The grant will only be paid once.

### You have further questions?

Then use our consultation hours! Or write an e-mail to cfs@chaostreff-flensburg.de. Mails to that address will be processed in a ticket system and might be seen by various people. To find out how to contact CCC in general, visit [this page](https://www.ccc.de/en/contact).
